# Alphanumeric-Quiz
This is my first game developed with AI, programmed in Python.
I created the game using the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.

The goal is to match the correct number to a given letter (e.g., A = 1, B = 2).
The game includes a robust scoring system, high scores, various difficulty levels, sound effects, background music, and a life system.
